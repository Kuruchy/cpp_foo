1. Mini-chess [chess.cpp]
2. A* Algorithm [a_star.cpp]
3. Small-Game [game.cpp]

I will be adding scripts that somehow had helped me at some point with rutinary work.

| ---- |:----:|:----:|
| 1 | chess.cpp | Mini-chess game |
| 2 | a_star.cpp | A* Algorithm |
| 3 | game.cpp | Small Hide&Catch game |
